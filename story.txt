Basic Plot:
  (This will be first part of the full story)
  Five people get transported into a magical world with dragons, dungeons, and magic. Among these people is the main protagonist
  which will be the person playing the game. They will choose their age, gender and name. With the protagonist came 4 other people
  Koen, Tori, Kevin and Tyree. These five people navigate their way through a world where a war between humans (the league) and elves (the mount) had just broken out and they each
  must choose to join a side. The protagonist will be influenced by the others choices when choosing to join a side. If the protagonist
  is a male then he will choose to fall in love with Tori however if the protagonist is a female then she must compete in an extreme love
  triangle involving everyone (not really a triangle) and her friend Tori. Through this war the protagonist can rise and become a hero, not
  choose a side and live an ordinary life or die in the process.

Story line:
  -All five of them wake up in an abandoned  house where they begin to argue (protagonist can choose to stop the argument or feed into it)
  -They decide to gather supplies and walk around a huge forest that surrounds them. They are met with two paths (if protagonist stopped the argument
  he can choose which one to lead them through, if not they won't trust him and they'll go to the other path)
  -Two paths form, the one to the left leads to a large lake where a man sits on a boat and they can ask him for information, the path to the right
  leads them to a bear.
  -If protagonist is in the lake he can convince the man to take them somewhere safe or also play a game for more info and then ask him to take them somewhere safe.
